## What is 3DCoat?

**3DCoat** is a powerful, professional-grade software application designed for 3D artists, modelers, and game developers. It stands as a comprehensive solution for the entire 3D asset creation pipeline, specializing in **digital sculpting**, **texture painting**, and **retopology**. Unlike many other 3D applications, 3DCoat offers a unified workflow that allows you to sculpt, create UV maps, paint textures, and render your models within a single, intuitive environment. Its core strength lies in its pioneering **voxel-based sculpting** technology, which enables artists to build forms as if they were working with virtual clay, without the constraints of polygon count.

With 3DCoat, artists and studios can achieve:
- Unprecedented detail levels in organic and hard-surface modeling.
- Streamlined PBR texturing workflow with smart materials and projection tools.
- Efficient automatic and manual retopology for creating clean, animation-ready meshes.
- Seamless integration with other industry-standard software like Blender, ZBrush, and Maya.

The software is extensively used in production pipelines for game development, animation, and VFX. By providing a robust set of tools for **3D modeling**, **UV unwrapping**, and **texture baking**, 3DCoat ensures that creators can focus on bringing their visions to life without technical interruptions. Its flexible licensing and perpetual options make 3DCoat a trusted and accessible choice for both indie developers and large studios.
